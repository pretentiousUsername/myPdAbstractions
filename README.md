# My Pure Data abstractions
These are a bunch of abstractions I use for my noodling in Pure Data, mostly
made to fit my own personal tastes. I'm going to assume that you're using
PlugData, like I am, or Pd-extended, or some other variant of thatâ€”my brain
isn't big enough to do everything in pure-vanilla Pd.
